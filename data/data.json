        "description": "Abstract: Optimizing emergency department (ED) nurse staffing decisions to balance the quality of service and staffing cost can be extremely challenging, especially when there is a high level of uncertainty in patient-demand. Increasing data availability and continuing advancements in predictive analytics provide an opportunity to mitigate demand-rate uncertainty by utilizing demand forecasts. In this work, we study a two-stage prediction framework that is synchronized with the base (made months in advance) and surge (made nearly real-time) staffing decisions in the ED. We quantify the benefit of the more expensive surge staffing. We also propose a near-optimal two-stage staffing policy that is straightforward to interpret and implement. Lastly, we develop a unified framework that combines parameter estimation, real-time demand forecasts, and staffing in the ED. High fidelity ED simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce staffing costs by 8% – 17% while guaranteeing timely access to care.

        "description": "Importance weighting is a classic technique to handle distribution shifts. However, prior work has presented strong empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrating that importance weights can have little to no effect on overparameterized neural networks. Is importance weighting truly incompatible with the training of overparameterized neural networks? We answer this in the negative. We show that importance weighting fails not because of the overparameterization, but instead, as a result of using exponentially-tailed losses like the logistic or cross-entropy loss. As a remedy, we show that polynomially-tailed losses restore the effects of importance reweighting in correcting distribution shifts in overparameterized models.We characterize the behavior of gradient descent on importance weighted polynomially-tailed losses with overparameterized linear models, and theoretically demonstrate the advantage of using polynomially-tailed losses in a label shift setting. Surprisingly, our theory shows that using weights that are obtained by exponentiating the classical unbiased importance weights can improve performance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our analysis with neural network experiments on a subpopulation shift and a label shift dataset. Our polynomially-tailed loss consistently increases the test accuracy by 2-3%.Tatsunori Hashimoto is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University.

        "description": "There are many ways in which AI can be used to support the teaching and learning process. For example, adaptive tutors and tutoring platforms help deliver one-to-one tutoring in particular subjects, and across the curriculum, voice-activated interfaces allow people to interact without needing to use a keyboard, and recommender systems help teachers to find the most suitable resources for their students quickly and effectively. However, for teachers to know exactly how to use AI with a group of students and for students to know how best to use AI to meet their requirements, they all need to understand something about AI. For this reason we have developed the concept of AI Readiness as a framework to support our conversations with teachers about AI and to underpin a training course aimed at providing teachers and students with a contextualised course about AI, specifically designed for people within education and training. The aim is that the course will help increase confidence within teachers and learners and enable them to make better decisions about the way they apply AI in their practice. In this talk, I will discuss some examples of the work that we have done with educational organisations using the AI readiness framework and I will explain the structure of the AI Readiness course we have developed. In the process, I will explain what it is about AI that makes it useful in education and how to know if the AI you are looking at or interacting with is likely to be useful to you.",

        "description": "There is broad agreement about the need for the development and application of AI to be subject to ethical guidelines and constraints. Equally, there is today little dissent from the view that the way we treat animals should also be guided by ethical considerations. Within the field of AI ethics, however, there is virtually no discussion of how AI impacts animals, nor of the ethical problems to which these impacts may give rise. Self-driving cars that might encounter animals, autonomous killing drones that target animals, and AI systems now working in factory farms, are all examples of AI technologies that have real impacts on animals. We will describe what is happening currently, take a peek into the future, and analyze some ethical problems related to these AI technologies. The questions raised include:When a self-driving car hits an animal, who bears the moral responsibility? Is it morally justifiable to let drones kill animals? Is the use of AI in factory farming good or bad for the animals? If an AI technology will clearly increase the suffering of animals, should a developer reject such a project even if it is legal?",

        "description": "Humans are capable of performing awe-inspiring feats of agility by drawing from a vast repertoire of diverse and sophisticated motor skills. This dynamism is sharp contrast to the narrowly specialized and rigid behaviors commonly exhibited by artificial agents in both simulated and real-world domains. How can we create agents that are able to replicate the agility, versatility, and diversity of human motor behaviors? In this talk, we present motion imitation techniques that enable agents to learn large repertoires of highly dynamic and athletic behaviors by mimicking demonstrations. We begin by presenting a motion imitation framework that enables simulated agents to imitate complex behaviors from reference motion clips, ranging from common locomotion skills such as walking and running, to more athletic behaviors such as acrobatics and martial arts. The agents learn to produce robust and life-like behaviors that are nearly indistinguishable in appearance from motions recorded from real-life actors. We then develop models that can reuse and compose skills learned through motion imitation to tackle challenging downstream tasks. In addition to developing controllers for simulated agents, our approach can also synthesize controllers for robots operating in the real world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by developing controllers for a large variety of agile locomotion skills for bipedal and quadrupedal robots.",

        "description": "The PSU Taichi for Smart Health project has been doing a deep-dive into vision-based analysis of 24-form Yang-style Taichi (TaijiQuan). A key property of Taichi, shared by martial arts katas and prearranged form exercises in other sports, is practice of a scripted routine to build both mental and physical competence.  The scripted nature of routines yields strong expectations on pose and motion that can be leveraged to perform interpretation by alignment, treating one performance as a reference with annotated labels that can be transferred to new routines by spatio-temporal alignment, analogous to the way a brain atlas is used to guide spatial interpretation of medical images. I'll discuss some research aspects of this project, including: 1) Collection of a large, multi-modal dataset of 100 sequences of 24-form Yang-style Taichi, performed by 10 subjects with varying levels of experience. Each performance includes simultaneously recorded Vicon 3D marker and joint data, two synchronized and calibrated video views, and foot pressure maps measured by Tekscan F-scan insole sensors; 2) Unsupervised learning of an encoder that maps short temporal windows of 3D body pose+motion into a vectors suitable for comparison by cosine similarity/distance, enabling efficient temporal alignment of routines by dynamic time warping; and 3) Learning regression functions to predict foot pressure maps (dynamics) from body pose (kinematics), and, more generally, developing methods to estimate biomechanical information like center of pressure and base of support, two key components for assessing postural and gait stability, from vision-only sensors. This is joint work with Yanxi Liu (CSE/EE), John Challis (Kinesiology), and student members of the PSU Lab for Perception, Action and Cognition.",

In this work we propose a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical representation of a digital twin and its associated physical asset. We first define an abstraction of the asset-twin system, viewing it as a coupled pair of dynamical systems evolving over time through their respective state-spaces, and interacting via observed data and control inputs. We formally define the system using a probabilistic graphical model, enabling us to draw upon well-established theory and algorithms from Bayesian inference, dynamical systems, control theory, and scientific machine learning. We demonstrate an application of the proposed foundation in which we create, calibrate, and deploy a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The digital twin is imbued with predictive capabilities via physics-based reduced-order models. The probabilistic graphical model is used to dynamically update these models in response to sensor data, and to perform dynamic analysis, prediction, and decision-making, all with quantified uncertainty.",

Earlier theoretical literature proposed stable improvement cycle (SIC) and choice-augmented deferred acceptance (CADA) mechanisms to remedy inefficiencies in such environments. However, neither of the two mechanisms is strategy-proof, and an equilibrium analysis is needed to thoroughly investigate their effectiveness. In our simple environment, we theoretically analyze studentsï¿½ strategic behavior (as captured by Nash equilibria in weakly undominated strategies) when DA, SIC, and CADA are in place. We show that the efficiency gain relative to DA exists for SIC but not for CADA. We then take our environment to the laboratory andï¿½for two settings with different numbers of participantsï¿½largely confirm our predictions with the experimental data.",

While more workers than ever have access to learning opportunities, information about the potential effects of these certifications on earnings has not scaled at the same rate. Using a new dataset from Greenwich.HR with salary information linked to posting data from Burning Glass Technologies, I apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a model that predicts salaries from job posting text with impressive accuracy. This model serves as the basis for the estimating the effect of salary premia for various characteristics, using a hedonic regression framework. I uncover the premia associated with eight in-demand certifications, in the fields of business analysis, project management, computer networking, and supply chain. Estimates range from 0.005 log points to 0.048 log points -- almost a tenfold difference for certifications considered in-demand. The real-time pricing of these attributes can provide additional information to firms and workers about how to strategically invest, improving decisions about human capital accumulation.",

        "description": "Despite recent advances in and many potential benefits of autonomous vehicles (AVs), there still remain several challenges until wide-scale adoption. The largest gap is in trust, where both passengers and proximal road users need to feel comfortable using and sharing the road with AVs. To bridge this gap, both prediction and planning algorithms need to include high fidelity driver models. This will help AVs to integrate better in mixed roadways and behave in a manner that conforms to the expectations of human stakeholders, helping to improve trust and acceptance. We investigate algorithmic frameworks that adapt to observed behaviors and balance route efficiency with safety. After demonstrating the benefits of context-aware, data-driven, multimodal predictions both for nominal and set-based trajectory prediction, we tackle the issue of handling prediction errors made online with a confidence-aware framework. In particular, a confidence threshold is adaptively updated online based on the consistency of behaviors with the corresponding predictions. This enables the AV to make efficient route progress when faced with a consistent target vehicle, but prioritize safety faced with an erratic target vehicle. In addition to the confidence-aware approach, we present an alternative approach that incorporates feedback policies in a stochastic model predictive control framework. Benefits in metrics of mobility, comfort, and efficiency demonstrate the advantages of adaptive feedback policies for multimodal predictions.",

        "description": "Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP). Many state-of-the-art models are first pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. When we only have limited supervision for the downstream tasks, however, due to the extremely high complexity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the fine-tuned model to overfit the training data of downstream tasks and fail to generalize to unseen data. To address such a concern, we propose a new approach for fine-tuning of pretrained models to attain better generalization performance. Our proposed approach adopts three important ingredients: (1) Smoothness-inducing adversarial regularization, which effectively controls the complexity of the massive model; (2) Bregman proximal point optimization, which is an instance of trust-region algorithms and can prevent aggressive updating; (3) Differentiable programming, which can mitigate the undesired bias induced by conventional adversarial training algorithms. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in multiple NLP tasks. In addition, our theoretical analysis provides some new insights of adversarial training for improving generalization.",

The recordings are composed of sequences of action potentials, usually referred to as spike trains, which carry signals of neural activity but they are contaminated with ubiquitous Poisson-type noise and the patterns vary from neuron to neuron, time to time, and trial to trial. The discreteness and randomness of the data make point process a suitable tool for understanding the neural signals represented by spike train data. This thesis provides four applications of point process modeling to spiking neurons. The first project addresses stability of fitted point process regression models. In the second project, we aim to bridge biophysical modeling and statistical modeling by describing how ion channel conductance can affect spike train patterns. The third project studies the covariation of time-dependent population firing rate features among interacting brain regions. The fourth project focuses on the inter-spike dependency between brain areas on a trial-to-trial basis. The talk will be focusing on the third and fourth projects.",

A critical issue in\ndata-driven decision making is the possibility that people intentionally or unintentionally obtain a\nspurious correlation from data and render it a causal interpretation, thus making\ncounterproductive decisions to society. A well-known phenomenon is Simpson\u2019s Paradox (SP)\nwhereby the direction of an association at the population-level may be different if considering\nthe subgroups comprising that population. For instance, an online platform seeking to test a\nmisinformation debunking application and observed from data that proportionally more people\nwho used this tool (treated group) expressed disbelief in falsehood compared to those who did\nnot (control group). It would be unsafe to immediately conclude that this tool is effective, as a\npotential reason might be that this tool attracted a large portion of educated people \u2013 those who\nare naturally resilient to falsehood \u2013 creating a seemingly optimistic yet distorted association\nbetween tool usage and disbelief in falsehood (called \u201cconfounding\u201d). Furthermore, even though\nsome users benefited from using this tool, there might exist a subgroup of vulnerable users\nwhose debunking capability were weakened (i.e., \u201cheterogeneity of treatment effects\u201d). In this\ncase, a decision made from spurious correlation might widen the inequality in online space.\nMy dissertation seeks to address confounded non-homogeneous associations in observational\nstudies as well as to support people to make fair and equity-oriented decision making. In\nparticular, I will develop automated approaches to detect subpopulations that differ in the\nmagnitude of their treatment effects wherein confounding effect is eliminated. It includes a\nrigorous assessment schema to measure confounder imbalance, strength of causal effects as\nwell as uncertainty for an arbitrary subpopulation. Furthermore, I will design a novel visualization\nto represent SP phenomenon, assisting decision-makers in three actions: understanding,\nmeasuring and identification, in their data-driven decision-making process."
